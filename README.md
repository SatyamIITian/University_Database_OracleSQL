# University Database SQL Project

Welcome to the **University Database SQL Project**! This repository contains a comprehensive Oracle SQL implementation of a university database system, including schema creation, data insertion, complex queries, and their results. The project showcases medium to complex SQL queries designed to extract meaningful insights from a relational database modeling university operations.

## Overview

This project simulates a university database with tables for departments, faculty, students, courses, course offerings, enrollments, transcripts, classrooms, and course prerequisites. It includes:
- A schema with 9 tables, constraints, and sample data for 25+ records per table.
- 50 medium to complex SQL queries demonstrating advanced features like joins, aggregations, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.
- Corresponding result sets based on the sample data, formatted as SQL output.

The project was developed as part of an interaction with Grok 3, an AI assistant by xAI, on April 11, 2025.

## Repository Structure

- **`university_schema.sql`**: Defines the database schema (DDL) and inserts sample data (DML) for the university system.
- **`university_queries.sql`**: Contains 50 SQL queries with questions, code, and result tables, exploring various aspects of the database.
- **`university_query_results.sql`**: Lists only the result tables for the 50 queries, numbered for reference.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing project overview and instructions.

## Prerequisites

To use this project, you need:
- An Oracle SQL environment (e.g., Oracle Database 19c/21c, SQL*Plus, SQL Developer).
- Basic SQL knowledge to understand and modify the scripts.
- Permissions to create and manipulate database objects (e.g., tables, sequences).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/university-database-sql.git
   cd university-database-sql
